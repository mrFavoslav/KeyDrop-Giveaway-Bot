# KeyDrop Giveaway Bot

KeyDrop-BOT is a bot designed to interact with the **KeyDrop** platform, automate and perform tasks related to giveaways. It can automatically join giveaways based on the set interval. This project includes a **client-side JavaScript** script and a **server-side C#** application, which work together to perform the desired tasks.

## Features

### KeyDrop Bot Overview

- **Server-side C# Application**: 
  The server handles settings, interacting with the Client-side JavaScript. It hosts a WebSocket server that allows users to set parameters like cooldowns, giveaways to join, and other configuration options.

- **Client-side JavaScript**: 
  The client script, running through Tampermonkey, automates interactions on the KeyDrop website. It listens for settings from the server and performs automated tasks on the KeyDrop website.

- **Release Pipeline**: 
  The release pipeline, powered by GitHub Actions, automates the building and releasing of the latest versions of both the server-side application and the client-side script.
